 * Client-side pagination over an already-fetched list — the same pattern

 * with nothing to filter (CrewsPage, PeoplePage) doesn't have to reinvent
 * it. Not used by LibraryPage itself: its own page-reset-on-search-or-filter
 * behavior is a different, slightly stricter semantic (reset to page 1 on
 * any filter change, not just when the current page becomes invalid) that
 * this was not worth complicating the shared API to also cover.
